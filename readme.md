## Climate Classification: A data-driven approach

Climate and vegetation, directly and indirectly, influence each other, where the question arises if there is a mapping between climate and vegetation. To discover the humidity-heat conditions for different vegetation types, which is a vital goal of climate classification, we are pursuing a purely data-controlled approach for climate classification. The KÃ¶ppen-Geiger classic climate classification system is based on heuristic and empirical rules, which may appear arbitrary and subjective.  Although these have been used dating from the 1900s, they have heuristic deficiencies, prompting various versions of modification.
