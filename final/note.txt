This final result is interpreted from som_66_hextop_merged, which achieves the highest homogeneity with vegetation.

Decision boundaries between tropical and subtropical climates are quite vague.
Current dataset only judges(tanh activation applied) monthly mean temperatures against 0C and 10C.
Setting an extra judger on a higher temperature(e.g. 18C or 22C) may improve this. 
But unlike 0C(freezing point) and 10C(commonly acknowledged as the lowest temperature for plant growth),
18C or 22C is subjective(human-imposed).
I would rather not involve too many human-made factors in the clustering.
